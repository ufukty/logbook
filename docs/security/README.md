# Security

## Backend

### Low level blocking

Application server maintains a log file which is also watched by fail2ban.

- The log file contains the failed attempts to perform API requests.

### User level rate limiting

### Authorization

#### PDP

The design shapes a **centralized** & **stateless** Policy Decision Point (PDP).

**Design constraints**

- **Verifiability**: Gather decision rules to one place to ease verifying implementation against requirements
- **Complex access control logic**: Due to collaboration and hierarchical groups
- **Distributed data**: Involved data in the decision process is too big and varying to gather in one place
